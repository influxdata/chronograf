/**
 * Redux store enhancer (https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/docs/Glossary.md)
 * responsible for sending updates on data explorer state to a server to persist.
 * It subscribes a listener function to the store -- meaning every time the store emits an update
 * (after some state has changed), we'll have a chance to react.
 *
 * After the store emits an update, we'll queue a function to request a save in x number of
 * seconds.  The previous timer is cleared out as well, meaning we won't end up firing a ton of
 * saves in a short period of time.  Only after the store has been idle for x seconds will the save occur.
